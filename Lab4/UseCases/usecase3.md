# Use Case 3

**Use Case**: Clear Canvas with Last Color

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To clear the the canvas and to fill with the last selected color.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: Pressing the space key

**Scenario 1**: The user will push the space key when they want to clear the canvas with pixels they have drawn.

**Scenario 2**:The user will push the space key with nothing yet drawn. In this case the screen should be filled with a default color.

**Exceptions**: There may potentially not be any pixels on the screen or no color selected yet. A default white color should be selected and filled in this case.

**Priority**: low-priority

**When available**: Second Release

**Channel to actor**: The user interactes through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard they will use to hit the spacebar.

**Secondary Actor**: NA

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: NA

**Open Issues**: There may not be any colors selected or pixels generated yet. In this case, a default action should be set like setting a default color and fill to white.
